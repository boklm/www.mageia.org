                    <h2 id="hw">Hardware Certification</h2>
                    <p>Mageia software runs on most of x86 computer systems available as of today, April 2011.</p>

                    <p>You can follow this hardware requirements list:</p>
                    <ul class="hl">
                        <li>Processor: any AMD, Intel or VIA processor;</li>
                        <li>Memory (RAM): 512MB minimum, 2GB recommended;</li>
                        <li>Storage (HDD): 1GB for a minimal installation, 6GB for a full setup;</li>
                        <li>Optical drive: CD or DVD depending on the ISO you use (network installation available);</li>
                        <li>Graphic card: any ATI, Intel, Matrox, nVidia, SiS or VIA graphic card;</li>
                        <li>Sound card: any AC97, HDA or Sound Blaster sound card.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Some additional, proprietary software may be required for some kind of hardware
                        like Wi-Fi chipsets or 3D graphic cards to work properly.
                        This software is available in a specific software repository called "nonfree"
                        (learn more) and will be automatically suggested at install time.</p>
                    <p class="dlinfo">We may set up a hardware compatibility list/directory, however that's
                        still at the planning stage. Feel free to join/contact our
                        <a href="/wiki/doku.php?id=web">Web</a> and <a href="/wiki/doku.php?id=qateam">QA</a> teams
                        if you would like to help in this regard.</p>
