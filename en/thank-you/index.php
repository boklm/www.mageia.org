                    <p>Since September 2010, Mageia would not have come to a reality without
                        the enthusiasm, advice and involvement of hundreds of people.</p>

                    <p>It would not have either, without help and donation from many people and organizations.
                        This page is here to remind of their contribution to this project.</p>

                    <p>Great places and teams that welcomed us and offerred us some tea, coffee, seats and advice
                        (mostly in Paris for now):</p>
